# Pokedex


This project has been created to test out svelte and tailwind.
The pokemon api has been used to show data. 
The api can be located at [api](https://pokeapi.co/)

## Landingpage

## How to run


First off, the images won't be displayed if not downloaded.<br>
You could use the .php script provided in the root of the project.<br>
If that does not suit you, then download them otherwise through the 
URL in the script
<br><br>
Then run the following command to quickly serve the app:

```
npm run dev
```

Afterwards the app can be seen at [app](http://localhost:3000)
